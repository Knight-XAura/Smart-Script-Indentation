# How to Configure?
  You can configure the plugin by going to Editor > Editor Settings... > Editor Settings > Scripts > Smart Indent and customize the settings

## What customizations are supported?
  All customizations currently work, although some pieces that are supposed to depend on that information is still hard coded, so line spacing results may not be quite as expected in all cases.

# Are any features only partially working?

Yes! Unfortunately thresholds of certain values don't format fully as intended in regards to amount of lines to insert and a fix will be coming in time. Also some values are hard coded into these other dynamic parts of code and so results may not be fully what is expected at this time.

# Any major known issues I might run into?

You should use this at your own risk. throughout development I've ran into some cases where a line of code may go missing. Undo of course brought it back, but just be aware.
